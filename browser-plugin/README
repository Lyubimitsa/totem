Notes on the plugin's internas

Special topics: Complex plugin
==============================

The complex plugin supports multiple plugins working together, see
[http://service.real.com/help/library/guides/realone/ProductionGuide/HTML/realpgd.htm?page=htmfiles/embed.htm].

To implement this, we maintain a list of totem complex plugins.
The plugins are partitioned into classes by their 'console' name; and a
random plugin (well, the first one instantiated) is chosen as representant.
This one owns the plugin viewer and all viewer interaction of the linked plugins
are done trough it. When this plugin is destroyed, we search for a new
representant, transfer the viewer ownership to it and update the representant
pointer in all of the classes' plugins.
