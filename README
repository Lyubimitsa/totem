FAQ
===

Q: Totem doesn't appear in the applications to open videos in Nautilus.

A: You probably installed Totem in a different prefix. Here is how to fix it.
   $ cd /where/the/totem/sources/are/
   $ cd data && make user-install

   And it should now. Enjoy.

TODO
====

- Maybe move it into monkeymedia? The only real gnome deps
  are gnomevfs and gconf, and i believe gtkxine depends on them already
  anyway. Would be nice to not have to pull the mm bits from a thousand
  places :)
- Removing hard-coded deps in monkey-media:
  <hadess> if you dl_open'ed the libraries when they are needed, i would
  be 100 % with it
- Play with OSD and stuff
- ports to other windowing system/OSes?
- Browser plugin ? See for examples:
  http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/modules/plugin/samples/default/unix/ for examples
  http://devedge.netscape.com/library/manuals/2002/plugin/1.0/preface.html
- split the baconvideowidget into a GtkWidget and a GObject (use a GInterface)
- add equaliser support to the API?
- be able to choose the deinterlace method?
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.xine.devel/4304/match=tvtime
- white bits on the screen when switching to fullscreen (more obvious when changing res as well)
- accessible subtitles?
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.xine.devel/3456/match=+api+addition+subtitles+accessibility
- implement a subclass of the checkbox menu item that takes two strings as parameters and switche between the two depending on the state (eg. Lock/Unlock)
- enhance the look of the controls popup in fullscreen
- fix the skip to spinner's range not getting updated (see update_mrl_label)
- register all the icons with the stock stuff (see bluecurve for what icons
we could be getting)
- rtsp plugin for xine?
http://www.live.com/liveMedia/#testProgs
- finish vanity
- add a mute menu item in the sound menu

From Iain:
> if (position_in_file > 1second) {
