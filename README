FAQ
===

Q: Totem doesn't appear in the applications to open videos in Nautilus.

A: You probably installed Totem in a different prefix. Here is how to fix it.
   $ cd /where/the/totem/sources/are/
   $ cd data && make user-install

   And it should now. Enjoy.

TODO
====

- Maybe move it into monkeymedia? The only real gnome deps
  are gnomevfs and gconf, and i believe gtkxine depends on them already
  anyway. Would be nice to not have to pull the mm bits from a thousand
  places :)
- Removing hard-coded deps in monkey-media:
  <hadess> if you dl_open'ed the libraries when they are needed, i would
  be 100 % with it
- Play with OSD and stuff
- ports to other windowing system/OSes?
- Browser plugin ? See for examples:
  http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/modules/plugin/samples/default/unix/ for examples
  http://devedge.netscape.com/library/manuals/2002/plugin/1.0/preface.html
- check that the fake event is generated more often, depending on the
  intervals of the screensaver
- split the baconvideowidget into a GtkWidget and a GObject

GStreamer backend TODO
======================
- brightness/contrast
- bacon_video_widget_get_current_frame
- audio cd playback, with cddb
- VCD playback
- DVD playback with menus
- fps, bitrate, fourcc information
- detect properly if there's a sound device
- proprietary plugins?
- deinterlacing
- network connection speed (mmsh://, http://, rtsp://...)
- subtitles and languages (not only DVD, ogg/ogm as well)
- better error messages (see xine backend for examples)
- aspect ratio changes

Bugs should be lodged in Gnome's Bugzilla:
http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=totem

To get a better debug output, run:
gconftool-2 --set --type bool /apps/totem/debug true
