gtk-xine.[ch] from gnome-xine, with the following enhancements by myself:
- port to Gtk+ 2.0
- real full-screen mode for _NET_WM aware window managers (metacity, sawfish2,
  kwin > 2.2, etc.)
- use of signals
- use of properties
- loads of API cleanups
- move all the internal data to a private structure

FAQ
===

Q: Totem doesn't appear in the applications to open videos in Nautilus.

A: You probably installed Totem in a different prefix. Here is how to fix it.
   $ cd /where/the/totem/sources/are/
   $ mkdir -p ~/.gnome/application-registry ~/.gnome/mime-info/
   $ cp src/totem.applications ~/.gnome/application-registry
   $ cp src/totem.keys ~/.gnome/mime-info/

   And it should now. Enjoy.

TODO
====

- move dnd to the output ctrl
- think of what needs to be in the prefs
- use  G_OBJECT_WARN_INVALID_PROPERTY_ID (object, param_id, pspec);
- finish the playlist
- make DVD playback work (autoplay plugins)
- kill GtkXine destroy bug
- first startup video
- work on remote displays
- stop one-broken-file long playlists from looping over and over (using xine_register_report_codec())
-
