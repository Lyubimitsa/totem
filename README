- port to Gtk+ 2.0
- real full-screen mode for _NET_WM aware window managers (metacity, sawfish2,
  kwin > 2.2, etc.)
- use of signals
- use of properties
- loads of API cleanups
- move all the internal data to a private structure

FAQ
===

Q: Totem doesn't appear in the applications to open videos in Nautilus.

A: You probably installed Totem in a different prefix. Here is how to fix it.
   $ cd /where/the/totem/sources/are/
   $ cd data && make user-install

   And it should now. Enjoy.

TODO
====

- move dnd to the output ctrl
- think of what needs to be in the prefs
- finish the playlist
- gtk_xine_get_stream_length only works while playing, that sucks
- fix up configuration (demux_strategy, audio out, default movie, etc.)

Bugs should be lodged in Gnome's Bugzilla:
